                <p>I think that at some point in everyone’s life, there comes the urge to do so many things at the same time. To learn new things, to change the way things are, to change the world... so many dreams, aspirations, hopes... I think it’s truly a test of how much “heart” each one has to achieve those dreams. Distractions always present, mishaps and mistakes committed, things not happening according to plan..</p>
                
                <p>But I know of a number of people who are very stubborn- stubbornly persistent. They show the world with pride that their dreams are way bigger than the difficulties they meet along the way.</p>
                
                <p>More and more I see and feel, that it’s the heart- the big capacity to love- that make them see the brighter side of things, that makes them creative in conquering difficulties.</p>
               
                <p>Indeed, it is like chasing sunsets. They are beautiful in themselves. But how much beauty you see, sometimes depends on the lens of the heart. For some, it's the usual Mr. Sun going to sleep at dusk. For a heart full of love, each sunset is unique. Each sunset gives a new a chance for a new tomorrow.:) </p>
